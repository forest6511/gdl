## Recommended Workflow

### Before Committing
```bash
# Quick validation
./scripts/local-ci-check.sh

# Or use git hooks (auto-runs on commit)
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

### Before Pushing
```bash
# Comprehensive check
./scripts/pre-push-check.sh

# With auto-fix
./scripts/pre-push-check.sh --fix

# Quick mode for iterative development
./scripts/pre-push-check.sh --quick
```

### Before PR/Release
```bash
# Full validation
./scripts/pre-push-check.sh --full

# Security audit
./scripts/security-check.sh --full

# Performance regression check
./scripts/performance_comparison.sh
```

## Installing Required Tools

### Essential Tools
```bash
# Linter
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest

# Security scanner
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest

# Static checker
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
```

### Optional Tools
```bash
# Local GitHub Actions runner
brew install act  # macOS
# For other platforms: https://github.com/nektos/act#installation

# Vulnerability scanner
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest

# Error checker
go install github.com/kisielk/errcheck@latest
```

## Script Exit Codes

All scripts follow consistent exit codes:
- `0`: All checks passed
- `1`: One or more checks failed
- `2`: Missing dependencies or configuration issues

## Tips

1. **Start with `pre-push-check.sh`** - It combines all essential checks
2. **Use `--fix` flag** when available to auto-correct issues
3. **Run `security-check.sh --full`** before releases
4. **Set up git hooks** for automatic pre-commit validation
5. **Use `--quick` mode** during active development for faster feedback

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Add proper documentation headers
3. Use consistent color codes and output formatting
4. Update this README with script description
5. Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
6. Test on macOS, Linux, and Windows (Git Bash)
